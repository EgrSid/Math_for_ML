# Math for Machine Learning

The "Math_for_ML" repository is a detailed resource designed for understanding and implementing machine learning algorithms from the ground up. The emphasis is on manually coding the mathematical foundations of these algorithms, with minimal reliance on external Python libraries. This approach helps build a deeper comprehension of how machine learning models operate at a fundamental level.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Core Algorithms
This section contains Python scripts that implement various machine learning algorithms by hand. The majority of the implementations rely solely on basic libraries such as [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) for matrix operations and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, with a few exceptions where [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is utilized. By focusing on manual implementations, the scripts provide a transparent view of the inner workings of these algorithms, bridging the gap between mathematical theory and practical application.

#### Example Algorithms Included:
- **Regularization (L1, L2)**:
  - Implementations of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques are provided to demonstrate how they can prevent overfitting in linear models. These scripts show how regularization modifies the cost function and impacts the optimization process.

- **K-Means Clustering**:
  - This script demonstrates the manual implementation of the K-Means algorithm, a popular unsupervised learning method. The code walks through the iterative process of partitioning a dataset into clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**:
  - An implementation of DBSCAN, which clusters data based on density rather than a predefined number of clusters. This algorithm is particularly useful for finding clusters of varying shapes and sizes, and the code illustrates how to handle noise and outliers effectively.

- **Gradient Descent with Momentum**:
  - This section provides an in-depth implementation of the gradient descent optimization algorithm, specifically focusing on the Momentum variant. Momentum helps accelerate gradient vectors in the right direction, leading to faster convergence. The script explains how momentum modifies the basic gradient descent algorithm to overcome issues like slow convergence and local minima.


### 2. `math_images` Folder
The `math_images` folder contains a curated collection of images and visual aids that are integral to understanding the mathematical concepts behind machine learning algorithms. These images serve as an educational resource, making complex topics more accessible through visual representation.

Youâ€™ll find images that break down key mathematical principles such as regularization effects, gradient vector fields, and the impact of different learning rates. These are particularly helpful for visual learners and can be used to complement the code and theoretical explanations provided in the repository.

### 3. Use of Libraries
While the focus of this repository is on manual implementations, some scripts do make use of the `scikit-learn` library to illustrate certain concepts more efficiently. However, the majority of the work relies on:
- **`numpy`**: Used extensively for matrix operations and numerical computations. The choice to use `numpy` aligns with the goal of building a strong understanding of how data is manipulated and processed in machine learning algorithms.
- **`matplotlib`**: Employed for visualizing data, results of algorithms, and various mathematical concepts. Plotting is an integral part of understanding how algorithms behave and how adjustments to parameters affect outcomes.
